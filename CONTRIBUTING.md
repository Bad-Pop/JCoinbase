#Contributing

Anyone wishing to participate in this project can do so. Whether it is to report a bug, to suggest a new feature or changes.

You can also freely take part in the development of JCoinbase by becoming a contributor. I would be very honored.

In all cases, you are asked to follow the code of conduct described in the `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file as well as the common rules of living and being.
