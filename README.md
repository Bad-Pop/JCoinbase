**This project is still under development**

JCoinbase is an open source client for the Coinbase exchange platform API. It's written in Java 15, but a Java 8 version is being considered. It allows you to make queries to the Coinbase API in a quick and easy way.

## Getting started

To make requests to Coinbase API using JCoinbase, simply instantiate a new `JcoinbaseClient` via the `JCoinbaseClientFactory`

```java  
JCoinbaseClient client = JCoinbaseClientFactory.build(yourApiKey, yourSecret, desiredTimoutInSecond, followRedirects);  
```

- Api key : Your api key generated by Coinbase in your profile settings.
- Secret : Your secret generated by Coinbase in your profile settings.
- desiredTimeoutInSeconds : A long value that defines the timeout in seconds for http requests. Recommended value is 3.
- followRedirect : A boolean defining if the `JCoinbaseClient` should follow http redirects. In common cases you should  set it to false.

_Notice that, if you pass `null` for the api key and the secret, you won't be able to access non-public Coinbase's data :  user, account, addresses, transactions, buy, sell, deposit, withdrawals and payment methods._

Then, you can simply call Coinbase resources like that :

```java
ExchangeRates exchangeRates = client.data().getExchangeRates("BTC");  
```  

Please note that, by default, returned values use Vavr data types for objects like `Collections` or `Option`.  
So if you don't want to use Vavr, you can always get java objects via the api.

For example :

```java
ExchangeRates exchangeRates = client.data().getExchangeRates("BTC");

io.vavr.collection.Map<String, BigDecimal> vavrRates = exchangeRates.getRates();
java.util.Map<String, BigDecimal> javaRates = exchangeRates.getRatesAsJavaMap();
```  

For further information on Vavr, please take a look at : [https://www.vavr.io/](https://www.vavr.io/)
